Hi there! That was a long way and I think I'm somewhere near the end — I'm relaunching my site. I can't remember how many there were versions of it when it was entirely in Russian, but that would be the second version of my site in English.

Oh, did I said I'm near the end? I lied. You know what is the main feature of this version? It's rough. It's terribly, awfully draft, broken and smelling. Don't look at the sources — you won't find there anything better than ugly barely working code. Really, I'm not joking. Why is it so? I decided to fight with my perfectionism. I tended to polish and polish and then polish more my site and it's code; I tried to show only the bestestest code I wrote and ideas I thought of. But now, this version — is so far from anything I would like. And that's awesome.

## The Goal

So, why did I rewrote the whole site from scratch? Why do I think that it's superior to the previous variants even in it's deeply rough form?

That's easy. I set the goal for myself: make a site that **would be easy to update**. That's it — all other versions with all engines I tried for them weren't handy for me. I'd need a lot of things to do for updating and filling the site or changing any parts of it. And I wanted to just write, write a lot. I have a lot of ideas for posts and things to put on my site, but I'm lazy. Any previous version was like a wall for me, the wall I couldn't make myself to jump over.

However, after a lot of prototypes, different engines and rewriting the whole thing several times, I came up with the solution that would fit me and would make updating my site a pleasure. Here it is:

## GitHub & Jekyll

I could praise and praise GitHub — all the work those people do is worth a bunch of articles. But I'll mention just one thing now.

GitHub gives you a way to host static sites — [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). You could take your repo, throw some static files in it and after a few simple actions you could look at your own static site either at GitHub, or at your own domain if you'd set it up.

But there is more: other than just hosting plain dull static files, GitHub allows you to auto generate them for you — using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme).

You could easily make a blog using Jekyll — it have everything you'd need for it: categories, tags, permalinks, generating feeds, etc. And as it's a _generator_, every page is generated just once, on your push to the repo, so it makes it nice for performance and server load — users would get just plain htmls. A lot of people chosen the GitHub as a hosting for their blogs.

I've chosen too. I've always had a lot of demands for a static generators — I write in two languages, have a lot of experiments embedded in posts and a lot of other stuff. Jekyll uses [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org) tempting engine, it's rather simple but with some guts you could do some complex things with it. I've dig it a bit and made a lot of small improvements for my blog — there would be at least several articles on that. And maybe someday I'll refine and rewrite all those things to a state of a standalone project that could be used as a boilerplate for a simple, but nice and powerful blog with all nice features included. So, wait for updates — there would be some.

## Prose.io

Ok, so I'm using GitHub, so I can just push the changes to it and they'll go live. But GitHub have a nice API — so there are some web apps that already use it and do a great job with it. One of them is [prose.io](http://prose.io) — and it works really well, I think I'll write an article or two on it someday. I really liked it.

## “Write an article”

How much times did I said “I'll write an article on that” already? The point is that I came with that New Year's Resolution — to write at least one article a week after launching a new site. But everything tells me there would be more articles: I have a lot of drafts and ideas to tell and write on.

So, just wait for it! I'll try to mix articles on the making of the new version of site with those I have already ideas for or with just anything that would fly there in a front of my eyes. 

And I'm not sure about the format of the blog/site, because everything could easily change, but I'm sure it would be fun.
