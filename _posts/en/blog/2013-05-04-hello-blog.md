# “Blog”

Hello! As I wrote in a [post on the relaunch of my site](:restart), the main goal for the new version was to ease the process of adding new entries. However, beyond the technical side I completely forgot about _what exactly_ I wanted in that easy and simple way.

Until today everything I published on my site could be divided to two categories: “[issues](/issues/)” and “[experiments](/fun/)”. In “issues” I tried to publish mostly objective things with all the proper arguments and thoughts went through a lot of thinking. Maybe those things could be called “articles”, but I don't like this word :) In “experiments”, on the other hand, went all those things like prototypes for some interesting things, just for fun, not as solutions for production, almost without any descriptions whatsoever. While _now_ I see a bit of sense in describing things (like I did with my experiment on [rotated text](:rotated-text)), I still don't like the style of step-by-step tutorials that describe every letter here and there. So, those things I publish as “experiments” couldn't go into “issues”.

So, why did I made it easy to write posts for my site? It's because I wanted to write _more often_. Not to publish articles or experiments (not that often for those), but to maintain a _blog_. Not to post objective, complicated things, not for some crazy experiments with hardcore code, but to have a platform where I could share something simple, something casual maybe. Simple ideas, thought, critics for stuff that's going on in the today's frontend world.

While it was hard to publish a new post on a site I didn't thought of it as a blog, but then I came to it and remade my site from scratch, but in a process I, again, forgot why I did all those things to Jekyll and myself — forgot that I wanted it there for short and simple posts. So, after the relaunch of a site there were not that much of new posts, but at the same time there were a lot of drafts and sketches for posts. I forgot that you could post things not polished to the shining, but short, rough and unfinished posts.

And now I remembered about all those thing, and here it is — a new category on my site. Well, “category” is a strong word here, it's just a way to cheat on myself and make me to write those not-so-long things. The fact is all those posts would still go to RSS, I still would share them on twitter, so nothing new there for you, except all those posts I'll write actually.

So, hooray, here it is, a blog. I'll try to post here often and to write some stupid things here :) Like when I somehow enhance the engine for my site, like I added the language toggler to the right top corner of each page, I would write on it. In those little things from changelog there are often something to share, not a lot of things, not something serious, but I'd like you to know why and what I do there. So, wait for more posts, and they'll come!
